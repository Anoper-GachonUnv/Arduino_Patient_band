# Arduino_Patient_band
Arduino code which sends BPM sensor value and gyro sensor  value through HM-11 &amp; TI CC2540 bluetooth module.
This code is made for sensing patient's heart rate information and movement. And then compute BPM value and send data 
through Bluno nano embed ble module(TI CC-2540). 
HM-11 should be setted as Beacon module with UUID as the Anoper ID and Cargiver's contact number.
